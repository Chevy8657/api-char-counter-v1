## 🔒 Sanity check (10 seconds)
After committing:
- Go back to the repo main page
- Scroll down
- You should see the clean formatted README rendered nicely

If you see that → you’re perfect.

---

## What this means (important)
- Repo description = **market metadata**
- README = **canonical contract**
- They serve different purposes — you did it right separating them

---

When you’re ready, tell me:
- **“Char Counter deployed”** (or)
- **“Render build failed”**

and I’ll walk you through the next exact move without jumping ahead.
